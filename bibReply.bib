  abstract = {Previous work [1] shows that the movement representation in task spaces
	offers many advantages for learning obje ct-related and goal-direct
	movement tasks through imitation. It allows to reduce the dimensionality
	of the data that is learned and simplifies the correspondence problem
	that results from different kinematic structures of teacher and robot.
	Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization,
	for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements
	are represent ed in relation to each other. Although task spaces
	are widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they
	are mostly defin ed a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic
	selection of task spaces. Observed movements are projected into a
	pool of poss ibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods
	that analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space
	descriptor s that match the observation best. As statistical measures
	cannot explain importance for all kinds of movements, the presented
	selec tion scheme incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based
	measure. Further, we introduce methods that make a significa nt step
	from purely statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based
	movement analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort
	and discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as
	a hint for important task elements. All method s are validated with
	realworld data, gathered using color tracking with a stereo vision
	system and a VICON motion capturing system.},

  abstract = {In robot learning control, the learning space for executing the general
	motions of multijoint robot manipulators is very complicated. Therefore,
	in spite of their ability to generalize, the learning controllers
	are usually used as subordinates to conventional controllers or the
	learning process needs to be repeated each time a new trajectory
	is encountered, because the motion variety requires them to consume
	excessive amount of memory when they are employed as major roles
	in motion governing. To simplify learning space complexity, we propose,
	from the standpoint of learning control, that robot motions be classified
	according to their similarities. The learning controller can then
	be designed to govern groups of robot motions with high degrees of
	similarity without consuming excessive memory resources. Motion classification
	based on using the PUMA 560 robot manipulator demonstrates the effectiveness
	of the proposed approach},
