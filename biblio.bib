	abstract = "In robot learning control, the learning space for executing the general motions of multijoint robot manipulators is very complicated. Therefore, in spite of their ability to generalize, the learning controllers are usually used as subordinates to conventional controllers or the learning process needs to be repeated each time a new trajectory is encountered, because the motion variety requires them to consume excessive amount of memory when they are employed as major roles in motion governing. To simplify learning space complexity, we propose, from the standpoint of learning control, that robot motions be classified according to their similarities. The learning controller can then be designed to govern groups of robot motions with high degrees of similarity without consuming excessive memory resources. Motion classification based on using the PUMA 560 robot manipulator demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach",

It allows to reduce the dimensionality of the data that is learned and simplifies the correspondence problem that results from different kinematic structures of teacher and robot. Further, the task space representation provides a first generalization, for example wrt. differing absolute positions, if bi-manual movements are represent ed in relation to each other. Although task spaces are widely used, even if they are not mentioned explicitly, they are mostly defin ed a priori. This work is a step towards an automatic selection of task spaces. Observed movements are projected into a pool of poss ibly even conflicting task spaces and we present methods that analyze this task space pool in order to acquire task space descriptor s that match the observation best. As statistical measures cannot explain importance for all kinds of movements, the presented selec tion scheme incorporates additional criteria such as an attention-based measure. Further, we introduce methods that make a significa nt step from purely statistically-driven task space selection towards model-based movement analysis using a simulation of a complex human model. Effort and discomfort of the human teacher is being analyzed and used as a hint for important task elements. All method s are validated with realworld data, gathered using color tracking with a stereo vision system and a VICON motion capturing system.",
